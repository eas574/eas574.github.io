## Course Description
This offering of Introduction to Machine Learning offers a peek into a variety of algorithms, methodologies, and concepts commonly grouped together to form the area of Machine Learning. Students will dive into understanding intricacies of several such paradigms, while being assessed rigorously to ensure clarity in the inner workings of concepts covered in the course. A detailed list of topics and their tentative dates of coverage are included supplied in the [course schedule tab](https://eas574.github.io/schedule/).


## Course Material
Any requisite material will be either made available through the course website.


## Assessment and Evaluation
Students will be graded through three primary means - theoretical tests, practical assessments, and a single take home test. The take home test’s weightage will be included into the theoretical tests components.

- **Theoretical Tests** - 60%  
- **Practical Assessments** - 40%  

Students will not be provided conventional cut-offs for grades. Instead, their performance relative to the class will yield them a grade. This will be done by clustering student grades by descending order, with the cluster with the highest cumulative scores achieving an A, and subsequent clusters being awarded subsequent grades respectively. If a student’s cumulative score isn’t a member of a cluster associated with a grade, then the student will be awarded a grade based on where they stand in relation to the clusters surrounding them. This decision will be made on a case-by-case basis. 

To understand where a student’s score stands w.r.t the rest of the class, an anonymized leaderboard will be available after the first set of assessments have been graded. 

In certain instances, or circumstances which prevent a student from completing course requirements, an Incomplete Grade may be assigned.  


## Academic Integrity Policy
Academic integrity is a fundamental university value. Through the honest completion of academic work, students sustain the integrity of the university and of themselves while facilitating the university's imperative for the transmission of knowledge and culture based upon the generation of new and innovative ideas. For more information, please refer to the [Graduate Academic Integrity policy](https://www.buffalo.edu/grad/succeed/current-students/policy-library.html#academic-integrity).
