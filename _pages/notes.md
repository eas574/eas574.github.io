**Students are allowed to use AI agents in their practical assesments to generate code or ideas. The course emphasizes inference of results and understanding concepts such as modeling choices which will have to be justified in the outcomes/deliverables. It is to note, however, that AI agents are only useful when the human in the loop is able to verify if the code being written.**

Pieces of code and examples, in this course, are often generated using AI agents in this course  - I suggest students AI agents of preference to generate more examples with more nuances to better under concepts covered in class. 

In 2025, AI is not the enemy of writing code, but a fellow passenger in the journey. It is beneficial to get accustomed to leveraging it as a tool to learn and accomplish tasks that would otherwise require more human effort, while keeping the thinking aspects of problem solving to the humans. Like any other tool or programming language, it is simply a tool to solve problems.
